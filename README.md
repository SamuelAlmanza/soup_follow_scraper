# Treehouse Web Scraping Project 

This script scrapes a Treehouse Github page internal links using the BeautifulSoup library.

The __main__ loop appends all pages to the site_links list so that they do not repeat, and then prints them.


TODO: Implement a function that scrapes and prints external links on the site.
